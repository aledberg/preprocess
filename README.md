# preprocess

This repo contains Python scripts and data that demonstrates the toolchain described in the manuscript entitled: *Transforming Sensitive Documents into Quantitative Data: An AI-Based Preprocessing Toolchain for Structured and Privacy-Conscious Analysis*.

The court data we process in the manuscript cannot be shared here due to that it contains sensitive personal material. To demonstrate the toolchain I have included openly available public data from consultation responses (remisssvar) related to
SOU 2023:62, a Swedish Governement Official Report from the Drug Commission of Inquiry.
The data in PDF-from can be found here: https://www.regeringen.se/remisser/2024/01/remiss-sou-202362-vi-kan-battre-kunskapsbaserad-narkotikapolitik-med-liv-och-halsa-i-fokus/, but text version (pdftotext) are available in the directort remiss.
